# Wikipedia_Course_Project

This copy of Wikipedia's 4 pages is a project I did in a group of 4 people for our Multimedia Web Development course. The purpose of this project was to show all the skills and knowledge we gained during our studies. 

By uploading this project I claim that it was not made to deceive, confuse, or scam anyone. No violation of copyright law is intended.
